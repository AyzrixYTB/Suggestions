/*

Thank you for translating our messages!

NOTE:
  1. You only have to change the thing betwene the ""!
  2. Don't change the variables like <Ping> for example! (Also don't change the name of the bot, so Suggestions stays Suggestions)
  3. Don't add other things
  4. Be serious, so don't write stupid things! (We are going to check that ofc).
  5. Read ALL the comments, the text above all the consts for example.
  6. \n means that the text after this will be on a new line.

  Questions? Contact jerskisnow#8214
