# Contributing
### Translation:
We are always looking for people to translate our bot. If you want to translate the messages for the bot or if you want to edit someone's translation please go to en_US.utf8.js and read the instructions. The next step is to fork the bot and create a pull request with your new/edited file in it.

### Code:
Feel free to contribute, not much to say here yet. If you want to add a new feature, create a pull request. If you feel like you want to improve some code that is currently being used, go ahead create a pull request. Anyways keep in mind that you use ESLint to lint your code and make sure your coding style matches the current one. Also, try to keep the formatting the same. One last thing, don't forget to write some documentation using comments in your code. Especially for functions. To get the project up and running follow these steps:
```
1. Run: git clone https://github.com/jerskisnow/Suggestions.git
2. Run: cd Suggestions
3. Create a .env file and copy the layout of .env.example
4. Fill in all the fields in your new .env file
5. Run: yarn install
6. Have Fun!
```

### Reminders (Dw, some are quite obvious):
 - Some command won't work properly without a database connection.
 - Test your changes before creating a pull request.
 - Use the language files for all non-admin commands.
 - Keep the same variable names in different language files.
 - Questions? Feel free to contact us!
