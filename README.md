# Suggestions
Hi, first of all, thanks for viewing this page! Suggestions is a discord bot that handles community made suggestions. People in your discord server can use the `suggest` command to suggest their ideas, other people can vote up or down. People with the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission are allowed to `approve` or `reject` people their ideas. Besides the suggest function Suggestion's also allows people to report bugs. For example, if your server is focussed on a game then people can sumbit bugs they find using the `report` command. You can also use this command to let people report user or whatever you want.
